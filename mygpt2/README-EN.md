## ADMIN_PASSWORD

Add a new secret environment variable `ADMIN_PASSWORD`

Set the variable value to anything, as long as you remember it, for example, `love`

If you haven't set this environment variable, you will need to check the console for the password, which will be randomized each time.

## Administrator Account Placement

Note: Since the data is not persistently stored, accounts need to be placed again after each Factory reboot.

Password: Enter your ChatGPT's password.

AdminPassword: Enter the value of the secret environment variable `ADMIN_PASSWORD`.
